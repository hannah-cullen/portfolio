## Nursing Home Targets for Staffing Service
   Using publicly available nursing home data sets, I analyzed a variety of different data sets to identify parternship targets for a staffing fill-in service. The target list would enable the company to partner with nursing homes or parent companies that would most benefit from increased staffing to drive improved health and wellbeing outcomes and experience of full-time staff and residents.
   
   Skills used to complete this project include data cleaning in Excel, data analysis, and data visualization.
